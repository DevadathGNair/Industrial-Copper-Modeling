# Industrial-Copper-Modeling
This repository provides a comprehensive solution for the challenges faced by the copper industry in sales and lead management. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the project addresses issues such as skewness, noisy data, and lead classification. The solution encompasses the following key steps:

1. Data Exploration and Pre-processing:
Identify and handle skewness and outliers in the dataset.
Transform data into a suitable format, including normalization, feature scaling, and outlier detection.
Perform necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps for optimal model performance.

2.Regression Model for Selling Price Prediction:
Develop a machine learning regression model to predict the continuous variable 'Selling_Price.'
Utilize advanced techniques like data normalization and feature scaling to enhance model accuracy.

3. Classification Model for Lead Status Prediction:
Create a lead classification model to evaluate and classify leads based on the likelihood of conversion.
Define 'WON' as success and 'LOST' as failure, removing other data points for improved model focus.
